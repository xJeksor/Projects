Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head
in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any
inhabited region. And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly
among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear.
Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert,
a thousand miles from any human habitation.It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked
me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him. It was from
words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of
his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.
